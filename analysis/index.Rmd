# Overview

In this analysis, we analysis mini-bulk data of LSKs from mice with various Smcd1 genotypes looking for differential expression between `Del` and `Het` mice.

After sequencing, expression was quantified by counting the number of UMIs mapped to each gene using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("scPipe")`[@tian2018scpipe].
Count data for all endogeneous genes (GENCODE Release 28 (GRCm38.p6)) and spike-in transcripts (ERCC) are available in this repository.

This analysis is adapted from [**RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR** workflow](https://bioconductor.org/packages/RNAseq123/) [@law2016rna].
